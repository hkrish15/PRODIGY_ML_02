Project: Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

Description:

Objective:
The project aimed to segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchase history, which includes the amount earned and amount spent. This segmentation helps in understanding customer behavior and targeting specific groups with tailored marketing strategies.
Key Responsibilities:

Data Preprocessing:

Collected and cleaned the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
Handled missing values and outliers to prepare the dataset for clustering.
Standardized the data to normalize the scale of features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted thorough EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Visualized key metrics and patterns using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
K-means Clustering Model Development:

Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm to divide customers into five distinct clusters based on their purchase history.
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to derive meaningful insights.
Cluster Analysis and Interpretation:

Identified patterns and behaviors unique to each cluster, such as high spenders, frequent shoppers, or budget-conscious customers.
Generated summary statistics and visualizations for each cluster to facilitate easy interpretation.
Provided actionable recommendations for targeted marketing and personalized customer experiences.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Visualization: Histograms, Scatter Plots, Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis
Clustering Algorithm: K-means
Outcomes:

Successfully segmented the customer base into five distinct clusters.
Enabled the mall management to design targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer engagement strategies.
Improved understanding of customer behaviors and spending patterns, leading to better decision-making and resource allocation.
